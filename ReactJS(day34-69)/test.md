I see your screenshot — it’s from **LeetCode’s problem-solving progress dashboard**.

Here’s what it means:

* **100 / 3700 Solved** → You’ve solved 100 problems out of the total ~3700 problems on LeetCode.
* **Easy: 50 / 904** → You solved 50 Easy-level problems out of 904 available.
* **Medium: 44 / 1923** → You solved 44 Medium-level problems out of 1923 available.
* **Hard: 6 / 873** → You solved 6 Hard-level problems out of 873 available.
* **0 Attempting** → This means you currently have **no problems in-progress**.

  * “Attempting” is when you open a problem and submit at least one wrong/partial solution but haven’t yet solved it correctly.
  * Since it says `0 Attempting`, it means you don’t have any unsolved problems that you’ve tried but not finished.

👉 In short: **You’ve solved 100 problems, and you haven’t left any problems half-done or stuck at the moment.**

Would you like me to calculate your overall progress rate (like percentage solved in Easy/Med/Hard)?
